## Delaunay triangulation
Delaunay triangulation is used for procedurally dividing a 2d mesh. It is divided using a Voronoi diagram. To be Delaunay it needs to have an empty circumcircle and form a triangle. You can also expand on this by adding a maximum or minimum angle to the triangulation to get nicer results.
This repository already has this built.

## Delaunay tetrahedralisation
Delaunay tetrahedralisation has the same principles as triangulation but is in a 3d space. So instead of forming triangles it generates tetrahedra and it uses a circumsphere.
Currently I haven't been able to make this but I'm working on it.
